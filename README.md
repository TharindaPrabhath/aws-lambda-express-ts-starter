# Serverless - AWS Node.js Typescript ExpressJs

This project has been generated using the `aws-nodejs-typescript` template from the [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) and extended the functionalities by adding [expressJs](https://expressjs.com/)

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [documentation](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/).

## Installation/deployment instructions

Depending on your preferred package manager, follow the instructions below to deploy your project.

> **Requirements**: NodeJS `lts/fermium (v.14.15.0)`. If you're using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the same Node version in local and in your lambda's runtime.

### Using NPM

- Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies
- Run `npx sls deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS

### Using Yarn

- Run `yarn` to install the project dependencies
- Run `yarn sls deploy` to deploy this stack to AWS

## Test your service

### Locally

In order to test locally, run the following command:

- `serverless offline start`

### Remotely

Copy and replace your `url` - found in Serverless `deploy` command output - and `name` parameter in the following `curl` command in your terminal or in Postman to test your newly deployed application.

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://myApiEndpoint/dev/status' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
```

## Template features

### Project structure

The project code base is mainly located within the `src` folder. This folder is divided in:

```
.
├── src
│   │
│   │__ index.ts            # Import/export of all lambda configurations
│
├── package.json
├── serverless.ts               # Serverless service file
├── tsconfig.json               # Typescript compiler configuration
├── tsconfig.paths.json         # Typescript paths
```

### 3rd party libraries

- [json-schema-to-ts](https://github.com/ThomasAribart/json-schema-to-ts) - uses JSON-Schema definitions used by API Gateway for HTTP request validation to statically generate TypeScript types in your lambda's handler code base
- [middy](https://github.com/middyjs/middy) - middleware engine for Node.Js lambda. This template uses [http-json-body-parser](https://github.com/middyjs/middy/tree/master/packages/http-json-body-parser) to convert API Gateway `event.body` property, originally passed as a stringified JSON, to its corresponding parsed object
- [@serverless/typescript](https://github.com/serverless/typescript) - provides up-to-date TypeScript definitions for your `serverless.ts` service file
- [serverless-offline](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline) - provides offline test functionality

### Advanced usage

Any tsconfig.json can be used, but if you do, set the environment variable `TS_NODE_CONFIG` for building the application, eg `TS_NODE_CONFIG=./tsconfig.app.json npx serverless webpack`
